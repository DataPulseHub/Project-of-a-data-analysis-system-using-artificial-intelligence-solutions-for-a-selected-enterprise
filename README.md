# Project-of-a-data-analysis-system-using-artificial-intelligence-solutions-for-a-selected-enterprise

The project focuses on the design of a data analysis system using artificial
intelligence solutions to improve the service provided to a particular business. The main
objective of the thesis is to design a predictive model of demand for bicycles on specific
days of the week. The dataset of the company City Bike - a system for providing bicycles
in urban spaces, with more than 110 million observations, including 17 categories, was
used for the research needs. References to scientific literature, specialised articles and
thematic websites were used in the study.
In the theoretical part, issues from the fields of artificial intelligence in the business 
context and time series including, with particular emphasis on the ARIMA predictive model,
were discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the characteristics of
the City Bike company and the available data. The practical part was divided into three
main aspects: data processing, exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling. The
built predictive model with a prediction efficiency of 79% proved to be an effective tool
in the context of demand analysis of the number of future bike rentals.
The results of the analysis confirm that City Bike is on an upward trend in terms
of the number of rentals and popularity with consumers. Successful demand forecasting
has facilitated the adjustment of the number of bikes to actual market needs, which has
an optimistic effect on the rental experience and customer loyalty to City Bike.
